# Regenerate src/gen/*.c for Super Metroid from a verified ROM.
#
# Generated C is derived from copyrighted ROM data and is never committed;
# every developer regenerates from their own copy. The ROM digests come from
# rom_identity.txt, which the build and the release workflow read too, so
# there is one place to change when a revision changes.
#
# Flags:
#   --rom <path>  ROM to generate from. Defaults to a known filename at the
#                 repo root, but the ROM does not have to live in the repo —
#                 keeping it on your own drive is the better habit, and
#                 SNESRECOMP_ROM sets it once for a shell.
#   --no-verify   skip the ROM digest check (for a revision this project has
#                 not been pinned to yet — expect the generated C to differ)
#   --no-cfg-roots
#                 do NOT seed analysis from the func declarations in
#                 recomp/*.cfg. You almost certainly do not want this: those
#                 declarations ARE this port's static coverage, harvested from
#                 the snesrev/sm decomp, and seeding them is what lets a clean
#                 checkout reproduce the AOT coverage a PLAYER gets with no run
#                 and no profile manifest.
#   --cfg-roots   seed from cfg func declarations. NOW THE DEFAULT (2026-09-13);
#                 the flag is still accepted so existing invocations keep
#                 working.
#   --profile-manifest <path>
#                 additionally seed optional AOT roots from a tier-2 coverage
#                 manifest (repeatable). This is the burn-down loop's promote
#                 step, NOT the default: the in-launcher "Generate & rebuild"
#                 wizard players use cannot pass a profile at all, so a default
#                 that used one made every developer regenerate a different
#                 program than the one being shipped. See the note below.
#   --strict-idempotent
#                 generate a SECOND time into a scratch tree and require
#                 byte-identical output. Generation is a pure function of
#                 (ROM, cfg, flags); anything that leaks run order or a
#                 timestamp into the emitted C shows up here and nowhere else.

# This title's own generation inputs. The PIPELINE is the framework's
# (snesrecomp_cli generate); the choices below are declarations about Super
# Metroid. They are plain snesrecomp_cli options (see `generate --help`), so
# nothing here forks the engine's pipeline.
#
# History, because this line has moved twice:
#
#   2026-09-11  A template sync replaced this script wholesale with the
#               scaffold's copy, deleting `--source-root src` and
#               `--profile-manifest`. That left profiles/attract_tier2.json
#               orphaned and silently changed the AOT/LLE split. Restored.
#   2026-09-13  Restoring them was the wrong repair. A developer regen and the
#               regen a PLAYER runs were two different programs:
#
#                 dev (this script)  --profile-manifest, no --cfg-roots
#                 player (launcher)  --cfg-roots, no profile
#
#               The in-launcher "Generate & rebuild" wizard is
#               snesrecomp_codegen_host.c; snesrecomp_codegen_host_autowire()
#               hardcodes cfg.cfg_roots = 1, and SnesrecompCodegenHostConfig
#               has no profile-manifest field at all, so a profile CANNOT
#               reach a player's regen. Measured on this ROM: 864 AOT variants
#               / 54 TUs the dev way, 4716 / 98 the player way. CI only ever
#               builds a SETUP HOST (release.yml asserts src/gen is empty), so
#               no job on any platform compiles or links generated C — the
#               configuration every player builds was the one nobody built.
#               Windows players hit undefined cross-variant symbols
#               (`<Name>_M0X0`) in it while developers saw a clean tree.
#
#               So this script now defaults to what the launcher does, the way
#               GundamWingEndlessDuelSNESRecomp's regen.sh already did:
#               --cfg-roots on, no profile manifest. --source-root src is gone
#               because it was a no-op — with no --source-root, v2_emit falls
#               back to <cfg-dir>/../src, which IS src/ (v2_emit.py, "if not
#               source_roots and not args.no_host_root_scan").
#
# profiles/attract_tier2.json is still here and still supported; it is now an
# opt-in promote step (`--profile-manifest profiles/attract_tier2.json`), which
# is what a tier-2 burn-down run wants. Passing it emits ~278 AOT variants that
# a player's tree does not have, so do not ship or benchmark against a tree
# built with it without saying so.
